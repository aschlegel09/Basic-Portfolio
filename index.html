            Ever since I was a little boy, I’ve loved the outdoors – which led my friends and me to join Boy Scouts! Camping is still
            such a thrilling experience. As I grew older, I knew I wanted to see the world, one country at a time. My adoration
            for the French language and formal art led me to study abroad in the City of Light – Paris. One of my best experiences
            abroad was playing competitive soccer with French students! However great these experiences were for me, they
            never gave me the same jolt of excitement that creating something does. Painting, cooking and now coding are
            all things that genuinely make me happy and make me feel useful.

            As I learn to code more efficiently, I hope to collaborate with other developers so together we can create, learn and build
            some amazing things.
